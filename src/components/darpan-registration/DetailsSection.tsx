          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is Darpan Registration?</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Darpan Registration refers to the process of registering a Non-Government Organisation (NGO) or Voluntary Organisation (VO) on the NGO Darpan portal of Niti Aayog, an online platform developed by NITI Aayog in collaboration with the National Informatics Center (NIC, MeITY). Launched by the Indian Government in 2015, the portal serves as a centralized and national database of Darpan registration for trusts, NGOs and VOs in India.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            During the NGO Darpan Portal registration, NGOs and VOs provide self-declared information about their activities, projects, sources of income, and other relevant details. This registration process helps the government and other stakeholders gain a better understanding of the activities and impact of NGOs across different sectors and locations.
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">The primary objectives of Darpan Registration for Trusts, NGOs and VOs include:</p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 pl-5 list-disc">
            <li>Facilitating Government Grants and Funding: NGOs receive a Unique Darpan ID upon registration, which simplifies the process of applying for government grants and funding.</li>
            <li>Enhancing Transparency and Accountability: By making the information publicly accessible, the Darpan portal of Niti Aayog ensures greater transparency and accountability in NGO activities.</li>
            <li>Creating a Comprehensive Database: The centralized database helps in the efficient management and monitoring of NGOs and their contributions to various social causes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Overall, NGO Darpan Portal registration is a crucial step for NGOs and VOs seeking to enhance their credibility, secure government support, and ensure their operations are transparent and accountable.
