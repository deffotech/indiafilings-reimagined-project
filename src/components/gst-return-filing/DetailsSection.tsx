        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
          A GST Return is a detailed statement that captures all the financial transactions of a person registered under GST, reflecting revenues and expenditures. GST filing online is a mandatory submission for every holder of GSTIN to the tax authorities, allowing them to determine the net tax liability with precision.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">The GST return filing online encompasses several critical elements:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> It records in detail the purchases the taxpayer has made.</li>
          <li><strong>Sales:</strong> It provides a comprehensive log of the taxpayer's sales activities.</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Who Should File GST Returns?</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
          GST returns must be filed by any business or individual registered under the GST regime. This obligation applies to entities whose annual aggregate turnover surpasses the specified threshold, which is set by the tax authorities and may differ for various classifications of taxpayers, such as standard taxpayers and those opting for the composition scheme. All those applicable entities must file GST returns before the due date to avoid late GST filing charges.

        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">If you submit GST returns late, you could face penalties and additional GST filing charges. Businesses should submit on time to avoid these costs. Here's what you need to know about late GST returns:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Filing Returns is Required:</strong> Every registered taxpayer has to file GST returns regularly, even if there's no business activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Delays Lead to More Delays:</strong> If you miss a filing deadline, you can't file for the next period until you've filed for the previous one. This can lead to a pile-up of late returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Penalties for Late Filing:</strong> If you file GSTR-1 late, for example, you'll get a penalty that shows up when you file GSTR-3B. You are required to pay GST filing charges for delayed filing.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest on Late Tax Payments:</strong> If you owe taxes and pay late, you'll be charged 18% interest per year on the amount you owe, starting from the day after the due date until you pay</li>
            <li><strong>Late GST return filing fees:</strong> The law sets the late GST return filing fees at Rs. 100 per day for each CGST and SGST, with a maximum of Rs. 5,000.</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Return Late Fees:</strong> For yearly returns like GSTR-9 and GSTR-9C, the late fee is capped at 0.25% of your turnover in your state or UT unless the government provides relief or changes the fees.</li>
