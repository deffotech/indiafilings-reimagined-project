          <p>ISO registration refers to registering an organization with an external certification body to obtain certification for compliance with one or more standards established and published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ISO is a non-governmental, independent international organization that brings together experts worldwide to develop global standards that address various issues and promote technological advancement. Applying for an ISO certificate online is a simple process where you submit your business details and required documents to a certification body. Once verified, you receive your ISO certification digitally.</p>
          <p className="mt-4">ISO certificate registration involves an extensive audit and assessment process by an external certification body to determine whether the organization meets the applicable ISO standard requirements. The certification body will review the organization's operations, procedures, and systems to ensure they comply with the relevant ISO standard.</p>
