        <p>Professional tax is a direct tax levied on persons earning an income by either practicing a profession, employment, calling, or trade. Unlike income tax imposed by the Central Government, professional tax payment is levied by the government of a state or union territory in India. In the case of salaried and wage earners, the professional tax is liable to be deducted by the Employer from the salary/wages, and the same is to be deposited to the state government. In the case of other classes of individuals, this tax is liable to be paid by the employee himself. The tax calculation and amount collected may vary from one State to another, but it has a maximum limit of Rs. 2500/- per year. To comply with these rules, the P tax registration must be completed by the respective entity without fail.</p>
