        <Section title="What is a Drug Licence?">
            <p>In India, businesses must have the right licenses for their operations, including those dealing drugs and cosmetics. A drug licence issued by the government requires firms to legally manufacture, distribute, or sell pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. These licenses are specific to each region, meaning a separate permit is needed for operations in different states. Moreover, a distinct pharma license is required for each location if a business operates in multiple locations within a single state. Selling pharmaceutical products which do not have proper drug licenses leads to the cancellation of a pharmacy license. Drug licence verification can be done by the officials to ensure the safety. However, there's an exception for mobile vendors.</p>
