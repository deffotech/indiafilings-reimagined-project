        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Importance of Timely ITR Filing for Companies</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Filing ITR 6 on or before the due date not only ensures compliance with tax laws but also offers 
          several financial and operational advantages for your business.
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Carry Forward of Losses:</strong> Filing on time allows a company to carry forward its losses for adjustment against future profits. According to Section 72 of the Income Tax Act, companies can carry forward business losses up to 8 subsequent assessment years.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoiding Penalties and Interest:</strong> Late filing incurs a fee under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act. Additionally, timely filing helps avoid interest charges on any outstanding tax liabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced Risk of Scrutiny:</strong> Timely filing minimizes the risk of scrutiny by tax authorities. Late submissions can raise red flags, potentially leading to notices and further examinations.</li>
          <li><strong>Quicker Refund Processing:</strong> Filing your income tax return on time facilitates faster processing of tax refunds from the income tax department.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Credit Opportunities:</strong> Timely filed tax returns are often required by banks and financial institutions as part of loan and credit facility applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Smoother Winding-Up Process:</strong> If a company decides to cease operations, having all Income Tax returns filed on time is essential for a smoother and quicker winding-up process.</li>
